# Voxel Maps

Required software
* MATLAB 

Required Toolboxes
* SPM 
* slover 

Slover is already very well [documented](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DisplaySlices). By default it opens a GUI to select the images to overlay (structural and statistical maps).

`slover_fp.m` simply uses a pre-defined slover structure. The users can change the path to their images, the matrix to select sagittal, coronal and axial view and other parameters using the slover object.
